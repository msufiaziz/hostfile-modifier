# DNS Resolver Client

DNS Resolver Client is an application that is capable to modify the system's host file in order add/remove custom IP addresses associated with their hostnames. This will save the hassle to manually edit the file and also save time since this application is able to add/remove multiple records at the same time.

Data will be stored in an external storage, eliminating the need for users to maintain their own copy. The data will be updated manually, preferably on daily-basis.

# How To Use

1. Launch the application with administrator privilege.
2. Right click at the application icon that appears in the notification bar (beside system's clock).
3. Choose from the menu (change host file or update current DNS in active network adapter)
4. When finished, exit the application by clicking the 'Exit' menu.

*(Note that the host file and DNS setting will be restored whenever the application exits)*
